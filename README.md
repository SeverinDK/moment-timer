## No Longer Maintained

As of 2024-04-04, this project, a plugin for moment.js, is no longer being actively maintained. The moment.js library itself has also ceased active maintenance. We strongly recommend users begin migrating to more actively supported libraries for future projects and maintenance needs.

If you're currently using this plugin, here's what you need to know:

* No New Features or Bug Fixes: The project will not receive updates, new features, or bug fixes.
* Read-Only: The repository has been archived, making it read-only. You can still fork it, but contributions, issues, and pull requests will not be accepted.

Thank you to all the contributors, users, and supporters who made this project possible over the years. Your support and contributions were invaluable, and we hope the project served your needs well during its time of activity.

## Synopsis
This is a Moment.js plugin that allows the use of timers, which offer much more control than the native JavaScript timers. It's basically a rewrite of JavaScripts own setInterval and setTimeout. For an example, see the example folder or read the Usage section below.

---

## Installation

### Npm
```
npm install moment-timer
```

### Bower
```
bower install moment-timer
```

### CDN
```
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/moment-timer/lib/moment-timer.js"></script>
```

### Browser
```
<script src="path/to/moment-timer.js"></script>
```
When using this plugin in the browser, be sure to include moment.js on your page first.

---

## Attributes

### (bool) start
```js
new moment.duration(1000).timer({ start: true }, callback);
```
Setting this attribute to true will cause the timer to start once instantiated.

---

### (bool) loop
```js
new moment.duration(1000).timer({ loop: true }, callback);
```
Setting this attribute to true will cause the timer to loop/restart once a duration is complete.

---

### (int | moment.duration) wait
```js
new moment.duration(1000).timer({ wait: 5000 }, callback);
```
```js
new moment.duration(1000).timer({ wait: moment.duration(5, 'seconds') }, callback);
```
Setting this attribute will cause the timer to wait for a specified amount of time before starting it's duration. This is kind of an extra first duration. Imagine a timer that runs every second. Setting the wait attribute to 5000 / 5 seconds, means it waits that long and then starts acting like a normal timer would. Notice that this attribute accepts both int and moment.duration .

---

### (bool) executeAfterWait
```js
new moment.duration(1000).timer({ wait: 5000, executeAfterWait: true }, callback);
```
Setting this attribute to true will cause the callback function to be called after the wait duration has ended. This is a way to make sure the callback is executed even before the timer starts.

---

## Functions
### .start()
```js
let timer = new moment.duration(1000).timer(callback);
timer.start();
```
This function will cause the timer to start. It can be used if the start attribute has not been set or if the timer has been stopped.

---

### .stop()
```js
let timer = new moment.duration(1000).timer({ start: true }, callback);
timer.stop();
```
This function will cause the timer to stop. It can be used if timer has been started to halt it.

---

### .duration(int | moment.duration)
```js
let timer = new moment.duration(1000).timer(callback);
timer.duration(5000);
timer.duration(moment.duration(5, "seconds");
```
This function can be used to change the duration the timer was instantiated with.

---

### .getDuration()
```js
let timer = new moment.duration(1000).timer(callback);
timer.getDuration();
```
This function will return the current duration of a timer. In this case it will return 1000.

---

### .getRemainingDuration()
```js
let timer = new moment.duration(1000).timer(callback);
timer.getRemainingDuration();
```
This function will return the remaining duration of a timers cycle. In this case, imagine that the timer has been running for 500ms and we call .getRemainingDuration() on it, in this example it will return 500, since half of the cycle has completed.

---

### .isStopped()

```js
let timer = new moment.duration(1000).timer(callback);
timer.start();
timer.isStopped();  // false
timer.stop();
timer.isStopped();  // true
```
This function can be used to see if the timer has been stopped by the .stop() function.

---

### .isStarted()

```js
let timer = new moment.duration(1000).timer(callback);
timer.start();
timer.isStarted();  // true
timer.stop();
timer.isStarted();  // false
```
This function can be used to see if the timer has been started by the .start() function. If this function is called on a timer that has reached the end of it's duration and does not loop, it will also return false as if the timer has not yet been started.
